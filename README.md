# Multiphysics Modelling of Fluid Flow and Solubility of Gases

This repository contains the work completed during my Summer Research Internship under the UM Virtual Internship Program at Physiomimetic Microsystems Lab at University of Miami, Miami, Florida. 

The project aimed to model the solubility of gases in unsaturated water solutions using COMSOL Multiphysics to accurately simulate the interaction between gas and liquid phases under different conditions. The simulations was part of a bigger project [1](https://diabetesresearch.org), [2](https://umiamihealth.org/locations/sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center) that contributes to the design of synthetic organs on a chip with fluidic microsystems. The solubility and diffusion of gases in liquids influence the functionality and efficiency of lab systems used in Biomedical Engineering. This project specifically addressed how gas concentration gradients develop over time and how these can be optimized for better performance in microscale environments.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Fluid Flow and Solubility Modelling

Utilized COMSOL Multiphysics to develop a detailed model that simulates the solubility of gases in unsaturated water solutions. The model incorporated the Fluid Flow and Partition Condition to accurately represent the interaction between the gas phase and the liquid phase.

- **Tools Used**: COMSOL Multiphysics
- **Parameters Studied**: Pressure, temperature, concentration gradients

### 2. Transient Study and Concentration Gradient Analysis

Conducted a transient study to observe how concentration gradients of gases developed over time in the liquid solution. This analysis was critical for understanding how gas solubility impacts the performance of fluidic microsystems in synthetic organs on a chip.

- **Analysis Focus**: Temporal changes in gas concentration, impact on microfluidic system design
- **Applications**: Design and optimization of synthetic organs on a chip
